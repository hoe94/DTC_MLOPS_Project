# DTC_MLOPS_Project
This is the end to end MLOps project I built through participated the MLOps Zoomcamp among 3 months. <br>
This project more focus on MLOps framework to achieved the productivity and reliability model deployment process.<br>
This course is organized by [DataTalks.Club](https://datatalks.club). Appreciated the instructors put so much effort on this course, so I can learnt MLOps related skillsets (experiment tracking, workflow orchestration, model deployment, Testing framework, IaC, CI/CD) for FOC. You can refer the MLOps Zoomcamp here [link](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/mlops-zoomcamp).

### Objective
The objective of this project is to help the company identify customerâ€™s credibility.<br>
So that it could help to reduce the manual effort.<br>
It uses the dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parisrohan/credit-score-classification).<br>
The dataset contains the credit-card related information of the customer.<br>
With the MLOps framework, we can achieved the productivity and reliability model deployment process.

7. Create the S3 Bucket by using AWS CLI for the Terraform state bucket
    ```bash
    aws s3 mb s3://[bucket_name]
    ```

#### Step 2 - Provisioned the Cloud Services by using Terraform (MLFlow Server)
Thanks for the inspriration from [Nicholas](https://github.com/npogeant) to setup the MLFlow Server on AWS through Terraform. <br>
He finds the gem on Github [link](https://github.com/DougTrajano/mlflow-server) about setup the MLFlow Server on AWS App Runner.

1. Download & configure the Terraform on your local env. [link](https://www.terraform.io/downloads)

2. Update the bucket under backend s3 for Terraform state bucket in terraform.tf under the path *infrastructure/terraform.tf*<br>
p/s. please dont use my Terraform state bucket
<img alt = "image" src = "https://github.com/hoe94/DTC_MLOPS_Project/blob/main/images/terraform_state_bucket_configuration.png">

3. Run the below command to provision the cloud services
    ```bash
    terraform plan
    terraform apply
    ```

4. Type "yes" when prompted to continue

5. Copy the *mlflow-server-url* & *aws-ecr-repository* from the outputs after complete run terraform apply

6. Enter the credentials to login into mlflow-server-url
    * user: mlflow
    * password: asdf1234

#### Step 3 - Setup the Environment
1. Activate the pipenv
    ```bash 
    pipenv shell
    ```

2. Set the environment variables for AWS configuration. For windows user please use Git Bash.
    ```bash
    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=[AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID]
    export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=[AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY]
    ```
3. Set the environment variables for MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI. For windows user please use Git Bash.
    ```bash
    export MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=[MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI]
    ```

#### Step 4 - Setup the Prefect Cloud
1. Sign up an account from Prefect Cloud v2 [link](https://app.prefect.cloud/auth/login)

2. Generate the API Key after create the workspace. Copy the API key after the creation.

3. Login into prefect on your terminals
    ```bash
    prefect auth login -k <YOUR-API-KEY>
    ```

#### Step 5 - Execute train.py for model creation
1. Run the batch script, init.sh to unzip & preprocess the data
    ```bash
    ./init.sh
    ```

2. Running the train.py under the path *src/train.py*
    ```bash
    python src/train.py
    ```
#### Step 6 - Data Version Control



#### Step 7 - Containerize the model into docker image on local env
1. Build the docker image
    ```bash
    docker build -t mlops-project-credit-score-prediction:v1 .
    ```

2. Run the docker image on local env
    ```bash 
    docker run -it --rm -p 9696:9696 -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}" -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}" -e MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI="${MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI}" --name mlops-project mlops-project-credit-score-prediction:v1
    ```
3. Run the test_predict.py to test the running container
    ```bash
    python src/test_predict.py
    ```

#### Step 7.1 - Build the docker image for AWS Lambda
1. Build the docker image
    ```bash
    docker build -t lambda-function-credit-score-prediction:v1 -f lambda_function.dockerfile .
    ```

#### Step 8 - Pushing the docker image into AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR)
1. login into AWS ECR. Please fill in the variables, *aws-region* & *aws-ecr-repository*. Please refer back Step 2.5 for *aws-ecr-repository*.

    ```bash
    aws ecr get-login-password \
        --region [aws-region] \
    | docker login \
        --username AWS \
        --password-stdin [aws-ecr-repository]
    ```

2. Set the environment variables for AWS_ECR_REMOTE_URI.
    ```bash 
    AWS_ECR_REMOTE_URI=[aws-ecr-repository]
    ```

3. Push the docker images into ECR
    ```bash
    AWS_ECR_REMOTE_URI="000300172107.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ecr_repo"
    REMOTE_TAG="v1"
    REMOTE_IMAGE=${AWS_ECR_REMOTE_URI}:${REMOTE_TAG}

    LOCAL_IMAGE="lambda-function-credit-score-prediction:v1"
    docker tag ${LOCAL_IMAGE} ${REMOTE_IMAGE}
    docker push ${REMOTE_IMAGE}

    ```
#### Step 9 - Deploy the docker image into AWS Lambda Function
1. Copy the Docker Image URL from AWS ECR
<img alt = "image" src = "https://github.com/hoe94/DTC_MLOPS_Project/blob/main/images/aws_ecr_copy_image_url.png">

2. Create the IAM role & Attach the policy by using AWS CLI for the Lambda Function
    ```bash
    aws iam create-role --role-name Lambda-role --assume-role-policy-document file://lambda-role-trust-policy.json
    aws iam attach-role-policy --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3FullAccess --role-name Lambda-role
    aws iam attach-role-policy --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess --role-name Lambda-role
    aws iam attach-role-policy --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole --role-name Lambda-role
    ```
3. Create the Lambda Function by using AWS CLI
    ```bash
    aws lambda create-function --region [aws-region] --function-name credit-score-prediction-lambda \
    --package-type Image  \
    --code ImageUri=[ECR Image URI]   \
    --role arn:aws:iam::000300172107:role/Lambda-role
    ```

#### Step 10 - Configure the environment variable as Secrets in Github

1. This is the step that when you want execute the CI/CD Pipeline through Github Action by create Pull request
<img alt = "image" src = "https://github.com/hoe94/DTC_MLOPS_Project/blob/main/images/github_action_secrets_configuration.png">


#### Last Step - Shut Down the Project
1. Delete the AWS Lambda, AWS ECR Docker Image & AWS S3 mlflow-model-artifact through AWS Console

2. Destroy the cloud services through Terraform
    ```bash
    terraform destroy --auto-approve
    ```

#### Bonus Step - Execute the model monitoring tools on local env
1. Go to monitoring_service folder
    ```bash
    cd monitoring_service
    ```
2. Start the monitoring services (evidently AI, Prometheus, Grafana, Mongodb)
    ```bash
    docker compose up
    ```
3. Execute the traffic_simulation.py to send the data
    ```bash
    python traffic_simulation.py
    ```

### Othters Step
1. added pre-commit into git hooks
```bash
pre-commit install
```

2. Setup the Makefile in Windows OS
- install chocolatey package manager, using power shell (admin mode)
    * tutorial 1: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2532234/how-to-run-a-makefile-in-windows
    * tutorial 2: https://chocolatey.org/install
    * video tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5WLKu_J_AE

- install makefile by using choco
    '''bash 
    choco install make
    '''

3. Run the run.sh batch script for the integration test
```bash
./run.sh
```

### Further Improvements
* Host the monitoring services (evidently AI, Prometheus, Grafana, Mongodb) on AWS Cloud through Terraform
* Standardize the AWS services creation by using AWS CLI (Step 1)
* Push the Docker Image into AWS ECR by using Terraform (Step 7)
* Create the IAM Role & Deploy the Docker Image on AWS Lambda by using Terraform (Step 8)
* Delete the items by using Terraform (Last Step)
